Abstract

The production of diverse and affordable agricultural crop species depends on
pollination services provided by bees. Indeed, the proportion of pollinator-
dependent crops is increasing globally. Agriculture relies heavily on the domes-
ticated honeybee; the services provided by this single species are under threat
and becoming increasingly costly. Importantly, the free pollination services pro-
vided by diverse wild bee communities have been shown to be sufﬁcient for
high agricultural yields in some systems. However, stable, functional wild bee
communities require ﬂoral resources, such as pollen and nectar, throughout
their active season, not just when crop species are in ﬂower. To target ﬂoral
provisioning efforts to conserve and support native and managed bee species,
we apply network theoretical methods incorporating plant and pollinator phe-
nologies. Using a two-year dataset comprising interactions between bees (super-
family Apoidea, Anthophila) and 25 native perennial plant species in ﬂoral
provisioning habitat, we identify plant and bee species that provide a key and
central role to the stability of the structure of this community. We also examine
three speciﬁc case studies: how provisioning habitat can provide temporally
continuous support for honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus
impatiens), and how resource supplementation strategies might be designed for
a single genus of important orchard pollinators (Osmia). This framework could
be used to provide native bee communities with additional, well-targeted ﬂoral
resources to ensure that they not only survive, but also thrive.

Introduction

There are 87 globally important commercial crop species
that depend on insect pollination (Klein et al. 2007).
Among the insect pollinators, bees are the most important
pollinating agents (Free 1993). Of the bees, honeybees (Apis
mellifera L.) are the single most important crop pollinators,
contributing not only to the diversity but also to the afford-
ability of many agricultural
food products (Losey and
Vaughan 2006; Klein et al. 2007; Garibaldi et al. 2013). In
the United States alone, the services of honeybees were val-
ued at 14.6 billion US$ in 2000 (Morse and Calderone
2000) (19.3–40.3 billion US$ when adjusted for inﬂation in
2012), and demand for pollination services is increasing as

ever larger areas are devoted to pollinator-dependent crops
(Aizen et al. 2008).

However, honeybee populations are threatened by a suite
of hazards, including pesticides, diseases, the mite Varroa
destructor (vanEngelsdorp et al. 2009), and the potential
indirect effects of loss of habitat (Potts et al. 2003; Winfree
et al. 2007) and host plants resulting from herbicide drift
(Mortensen et al. 2012). These threats have highlighted the
dependency of modern agriculture on increasingly threa-
tened pollination services (Gallai et al. 2009).

While honeybees are traditionally considered to be the
most valuable pollinators (Free 1993), they are not the
most efﬁcient pollinators for all crops. Native bees are
often efﬁcient and sometimes superior pollinators, and

contribute signiﬁcantly to crop yield (Klein et al. 2003;
Greenleaf and Kremen 2006; Losey and Vaughan 2006).
For example, for “Red Delicious” apples, ﬂowers visited
by Osmia cornuta were ﬁve times more likely to set fruit
than honeybee-visited ﬂowers, and resulting fruits were
larger when ﬂowers were visited by O. cornuta (Vicens
and Bosch 2000). The value of pollination services pro-
vided by wild bees has been estimated at approximately
3.07 billion US$ in the United States alone (Losey and
Vaughan 2006) and they were globally valued at 248 bil-
lion US$ in 2009 (Gallai et al. 2009). Native bees are
capable of fully supplying the pollination services required
by certain crops (Winfree et al. 2007), but require sufﬁ-
cient habitat with ﬂoral and nesting resources to maintain
a population size large enough to be effective crop pollin-
ators (Kremen et al. 2004; Cane 2008). In response to
for example, there have been declines in
habitat loss,
native bee populations in the northeastern United States
(Bartomeus et al. 2013). Supplementing habitat for native
bees may provide the additional beneﬁt of supporting
managed bee populations (Carvalheiro et al. 2012). For
example, Carvalheiro et al. (2012) found increased honey-
bee contribution to the pollination of mangoes when
ﬂoral provisioning resources were provided for native bees.

syndromes, without

Both in response to threats to honeybees, and in recogni-
tion of the potential beneﬁts of augmenting wild bees,
methods are being developed to conserve native and
domesticated bee populations. One
strategy involves
managing agricultural ﬁeld edges to increase the diversity
of ﬂoral provisioning resources (Winfree et al. 2008; Egan
and Mortensen 2012) and the abundance of speciﬁc ﬂoral
hosts (Isaacs et al. 2009). Current recommendations for
selecting ﬂoral provisioning species are often based on pol-
incorporating information
linator
about actual
insect visitation frequencies (e.g., NAPPC
(North American Pollinator Protection Campaign) 2011).
However, selecting the best plants for provisioning wild
pollinators with nectar and pollen resources can be difﬁcult
because visitation rates often depend on multiple complex
ﬂoral characters (Thompson 2001). The quality and quan-
tity of resources provided by ﬂower species can vary signiﬁ-
cantly, and quantifying these resources can be challenging
(Kearns and Inouye 1993). For this study, we asked the
question: given the threats to pollinators, how can we
promote stability and diversity of bee communities that
provide pollination services to crops?

To make a more informed decision about the plant spe-
cies that might be used to conserve bee communities, and
to identify bee species that might also visit a wide variety
of crop species,
it is necessary to observe interactions
between bees and plants. These observations can then be
used to capture community interaction structure in the
form of bipartite mutualistic networks (Memmott 1999).

Such networks have recently gained attention in the scien-
tiﬁc literature as a vital tool for understanding how ecolog-
ical communities form and function (Memmott 1999;
Olesen et al. 2008; Campbell et al. 2011). Here we show
that these methods can also be used to address the real-
world management problem of how to improve ﬂoral pro-
visioning with the objective of conserving native and man-
aged bee populations to provide crop pollination services.

Speciﬁcally, we use network measures to assess the sta-
bility of community interaction structure over time and
the role of individual species. These measures allow us to
investigate the roles of individual plant species in the con-
nectivity of the pollinator community, and we thus are
able to rank them. Our analyses include one novel “node
duration” measure to demonstrate how phenology relates
to the importance of species, but we also show how inter-
action phenology can be used to match pollinators with a
suite of plants that provide continuous ﬂoral provisioning
resources throughout the season and how the phenology
of the interacting species relates to the stability of the
community as a whole over time.

We investigate three case studies to demonstrate how
our framework might be used to target management
objectives. First, we demonstrate how ﬂoral resources
might beneﬁt the domesticated honeybee (A. mellifera).
We show that the provisioning habitat could be used to
complement and supplement crop species, and to provide
continuous resources throughout the active season. Sec-
ond, we demonstrate how a generalist bee species, the
common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), could be
supported by multiple ﬂoral provisioning species through-
out the summer. A. mellifera has long been used in agri-
culture, whereas B.
impatiens has only been recently
domesticated (i.e., in the 1970s, Velthuis and van Doorn
2006); both might beneﬁt
from additional and varied
resources (Carvalheiro et al. 2012).

Next, we focus on the genus Osmia; some Osmia species
have gained attention because of their potential to be man-
aged as orchard pollinators (Vicens and Bosch 2000; Bosch
and Kemp 2002; Gruber et al. 2011). For example, Osmia
lignaria, O. cornifrons, and O. cornuta are sometimes man-
aged as pollinators of almonds, cherries, plums, pears, and
apples (Bosch and Kemp 2002). In most cases, the bloom
period of these crop plants corresponds directly with the
natural activity period of native Osmia spp. (Bosch and
Kemp 2002). Although they prefer ﬂowers of orchard trees
when available, they require other resources when orchards
are not ﬂowering (Bosch and Kemp 2002). Floral resource
provisioning in an orchard setting could help sustain O.
lignaria populations when crop ﬂowering is poor (e.g.,
when a hard freeze or pest infestation kills buds or blos-
soms) and also help to build local populations over time.
As other Osmia spp. may also be effective crop pollinators,

because they represent appropriate taxa for ﬂoral provi-
sioning with native pollinators and require less mainte-
nance than plants not adapted to the local climate (Isaacs
et al. 2009). Each block consisted of individual plants,
separated by 3 m, within a 12 m 9 12 m grid. Blocks
were aligned in a single row and positioned 6 m apart.
The effect of blocks was not signiﬁcant, and we subse-
quently pool visitors from each species and across both
years that bees were collected (2008 and 2009). The pur-
pose of the randomized complete block design was there-
fore to ensure that each plant was treated as an individual
experimental unit, and also to ensure a relatively even
spatial distribution of the species.

In the summers of 2008 and 2009, we vacuum sampled
the ﬂowers every other week from May to October with a
modiﬁed leaf blower
(Craftsman, model #358794760,
Hoffman Estates, IL) (Tuell et al. 2008; DeBarros 2010).
On a sampling day, each individual plant was vacuumed
from 0900–
for 15 sec
1200 EST and again from 1300-1600 Eastern Standard
Time (EST). Therefore, there were a total of 18.3 sam-
pling hours on this community between the 2 years.

in a

We also measured a number of other plant characteris-
tics, such as the area of each individual ﬂower and the total
number of ﬂowers across both seasons. The average planar
ﬂoral area of an individual blossom was measured for each
species by taking digital photographs of 10 representative
blossoms or blossom clusters on each individual plant,
keeping a metric ruler in each photographic frame for
reference. We then used Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended
(Version 11.0, Adobe 2008) to calculate the area of the
blossom in each photograph, and averaged across the 10
photographs for each individual. The total ﬂoral area for
individual plants was then estimated for each week by
multiplying the number of observed ﬂowers by the average
blossom area for the species (DeBarros 2010). Floral visi-
tors of the superfamily Apoidea were pinned and identiﬁed
to the species level, except for 62 Lasioglossum specimens
that could only be resolved to morphospecies because they
were too damaged to be identiﬁed or were males. Males of
the genus Lasioglossum are not well resolved, and are often
impossible to separate taxonomically (S. Droege, pers.
comm.). Thus, they likely represent more than one species.
Nonetheless, due to their impact on the visitation rates of
plants, it was inappropriate to leave the specimens out of
the analysis entirely. For all species, we deposited voucher
specimens in the collections at the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Agriculture in Harrisburg, PA.

Network construction and analysis

From ﬂoral visitation events, we
constructed both
weighted and unweighted bipartite networks with plant

and bee nodes, using a visitation event as an interaction
(Fig. 1), with the “bipartite” package in R (Memmott
1999; Dormann et al. 2008). The interaction network
comprised visitation events
from both years and all
blocks. A weighted version was scaled by the abundance
of bees collected on ﬂowers, whereas an unweighted ver-
sion of the network documented the presence or absence
of species interactions only.

To evaluate the effect of phenology on network struc-
ture, we separated the season into early (May and June),
middle (July and the ﬁrst half of August), and late (from
the second half of August through the ﬁrst half of Octo-
ber) summer. These periods were chosen based on the
ﬂowering phenology of the plant species in the ﬂoral pro-
visioning habitat. For each of these periods of the sum-
mer, we evaluated the size, nestedness, and connectance
of the network. The size of the network at any given time
is the sum of the species richness of interacting plant and
bee species. Nestedness

stability and robustness (Th(cid:1)ebault and Fontaine 2010;

tive to network size (Nielsen and Bascompte 2007).
Connectance has been theoretically shown to relate to the
complexity and robustness of a community to species loss

On a node level (i.e., individual species), there are many
ways to rank the species in the context of the community.
Here, we evaluated the specialization, relative abundance,
centrality, and duration of plant–pollinator interactions.
As we were especially interested in identifying key plant

species for ﬂoral provisioning, we also examined the num-
ber of visits each ﬂower species received relative to their
ﬂoral display, and ranked the plant species by their func-
tional complementarity (Devoto et al. 2012). We tested
for correlations between separate rankings using a Spear-
man’s correlation coefﬁcient.

We ﬁrst identiﬁed generalist plants and pollinators as
those species with the highest degree (i.e., largest number
of species interactions; Memmott 1999); in network par-
lance, this can be referred to as degree centrality (Opsahl
et al. 2010). Generalist plants support pollinator diversity,
which in turn has been shown to provide increased crop
yields (Klein et al. 2003; Garibaldi et al. 2013), especially
given year to year variation in native bee populations. In
turn, generalist pollinators are assumed to be more likely
to visit not only plants in the ﬂoral provisioning habitat
but also many crop species because they are less selective
about where they obtain ﬂoral resources (Memmott 1999;
Tylianakis et al. 2010).

We then identiﬁed plant species that supported large
numbers of ﬂoral visitors by weighting interactions with
interaction frequency to generate a quantitative network
(Memmott 1999). The weighted degree of a node is the
total abundance of all its interactions. Plant nodes with a
high weighted degree are visited more. Highly visited
plants likely support pollinator population growth and
improve pollination services, especially if
they provide
both nectar and pollen, although they may also function
as mating or nesting sites.
In addition, some plants
received a high frequency of visits despite having a rela-
tively small ﬂoral display. We identiﬁed such species as
those that were outside of a 95% conﬁdence interval of
the correlation between ﬂoral display and visitation fre-
they had more visitors than
quency. In other words,
would be expected given the relationship between ﬂoral
area and visitation frequency.

We used two additional separate measures of centrality
in addition to degree centrality, both of which are com-
mon in the literature, for identifying the importance of
individual nodes
to network structure and stability
(Jord(cid:1)an et al. 2007). Betweenness centrality ranks species
as connectors between other species in the community,
whereas closeness centrality ranks species relative to their
topological proximity to other species in the community
(Mart(cid:1)ın Gonz(cid:1)alez et al. 2007). As the interactions between
plants and pollinators generate bipartite networks, we
made single-mode projections of the plant species and
pollinator species before calculating centrality. In the sin-
gle-mode projections,
links are formed between species
that share interacting partners (e.g., plant species that
share one or more pollinator species).

We used duration of activity through the season of the
plant and bee species as another measure of importance.

for

resources

For example, pollinators that actively forage for longer
periods will likely visit multiple crop species with differ-
ing ﬂoral phenologies. Similarly, plant species that pro-
vide ﬂoral
longer periods can support
pollinators when crops are not ﬂowering. We deﬁne this
new measure, which we term node duration, as the num-
ber of times out of the total number of samples that a
species participates in the network. This measure is dis-
tinct from other measures of node dynamics in the litera-
ture (e.g., phenophase as deﬁned by Olesen et al. 2008)
because it only accounts for the presence of the species
within the network. For example, the phenophase of a
plant species is the period between the opening of its ﬁrst
ﬂower and the senescence of its last ﬂower (Olesen et al.
2008), whereas node duration is strictly deﬁned by the
number of times the plant species interacts with ﬂoral vis-
itors in the community.

in the

Finally, we calculated the functional complementarity
of
the plant species. Functional complementarity is a
measure of how individual plant species support separate
functional groups of pollinators
community
(Devoto et al. 2012). Plants that are visited by distinct
groups of pollinators will therefore increase the functional
complementarity of the community more than species
that share the same species of pollinators. If there are
constraints on the number of plants available for ﬂoral
provisioning habitat, one might select a combination that
maximizes functional complementarity to support
the
largest diversity of pollinators. As suggested by Devoto
et al. (2012), we use branch lengths in a functional
dendrogram based on a distance matrix generated from
an interaction matrix. Here, we removed the species one
by one in such a way as to maximize the functional com-
plementarity of the community at each number of spe-
cies. Thus, the order that the species are removed reﬂects
a gradient from the species that are least critical to com-
plementarity to those that are most critical.

Example with target groups

To demonstrate how the ﬂoral provisioning species could
complement and supplement ﬂowering crop species, we
created a separate phenology graph incorporating the
interaction phenology of A. mellifera and the plant species
it visited over the season. We compared the interaction

ing phenology of ﬁve pollinator-dependent crop species
commonly found in the study area. We performed a simi-
lar analysis with B. impatiens for comparison. (Readers

With the objective of conserving Osmia spp., we cre-
ated a separate interaction network of the four Osmia
spp.
found in our provisioning habitat (O. atriventris,
O. bucephala, O. cornifrons, and O. pumila) and the ﬂow-
ers they visited. We also evaluated the interaction phenol-
ogy of the Osmia spp. to determine when they visited the
provisioning habitat.

Results

Over the two summers that the ﬂoral provisioning habitat
was sampled, 64 bee species were captured while visiting
the 25 perennial plant species. There were a total of 1651
specimens captured, representing a total of 261 unique
insect–ﬂower species interactions. We performed an inter-
action rarefaction to estimate the completeness of our
sampling (a Chao 1 estimator, see Chacoff et al. 2012),
and found that we captured 60.5% of
the maximum
number of expected interactions, a result consistent with
other similar plant–pollinator communities, despite differ-
ing sampling methods (e.g., Chacoff et al. 2012; Devoto
et al. 2012).

The community was dynamic across

the summer,
changing in size, nestedness, and connectance (Table 2).
The community was largest in both the number of plant
and insect species in the middle of the summer, and
smallest early in the summer. The nestedness followed the
same trend, being highest in the middle of the summer
and lowest early in the summer, but the connectance fol-
lowed an opposite trend, being lowest in the middle of
the summer and highest early in the summer. When the
interactions were pooled across the whole season,
the
nestedness was also maximized, but
the connectance
remained lower than the separate periods of the summer.
However,
the network size was below 50 species for
the early division of the summer, and the measure of

We assessed the importance of plant and bee species in
the context of the full network (Fig. 2) with ﬁve network
measures: unweighted degree, weighted degree, between-
ness, and closeness centrality, as well as node duration. Un-
weighted degree and weighted degree are correlated with
each other and to both other measures of centrality, as well
as functional complementarity in the plants (P << 0.01 for
all except ﬂoral area and node duration, for which P ~ 0.02,

cantly correlated with ﬂoral area or node duration in the
plants (Table 1A). In contrast, all measures are signiﬁcantly
correlated with each other in the bee species (P << 0.01,

individual species tend to be specialists, or rare. This poorly
known group may therefore require more study in the
future, including the development of better guides for the
identiﬁcation of male specimens. If we remove the effect of
the unresolved Lasioglossum spp., B. impatiens was both the
most generalist species and most abundant. Its abundance
was more than twice that of any other bee species. How-
ever, Ceratina calcarata had the highest ranking in both
measures of centrality and A. mellifera had the longest
duration of activity, from June to October. Importantly,
though we found signiﬁcant correlations between weighted
degree, unweighted degree, betweenness, and closeness cen-
trality, and node duration, (P << 0.01), each measure
ranks the species differently.

is therefore that the genus Lasioglossum as a whole is an

The method of ranking may be adapted according to
speciﬁc conservation goals. To show how one might select
species to provide continuous ﬂoral resources for a target
pollinator with a long duration of activity, we use the
species visited by the honeybee (A. mellifera) as an exam-
ple. The honeybee shifts its frequency of visitation from
one species to another throughout the season; to ensure
continuous resources, a manager would choose plants
from each of the three periods (Fig. 6A). Floral resources
could thus be available for this important domesticated
pollinator when crop species are not in ﬂower. In addi-
tion, we provide the approximate ﬂowering times for ﬁve
pollinator-dependent and high-yield crops in Pennsylva-
nia (Fig. 6B). In contrast to the honeybee, the bumblebee
(B. impatiens) was found to be extremely generalist, visit-
ing multiple ﬂoral provisioning species within each time
period (Fig. 7). This suggests that the bumblebee relies
less on any single ﬂoral provisioning species and may be
well supported by a wide variety of species.

(Fig. 8),

Although Osmia spp. were not

frequent visitors in
our ﬂoral resource provisioning habitat, we provide pre-
liminary analyses as to the species that they visited. Our
network demonstrates that the four Osmia spp.
in the
ﬂoral provisioning site visited only three plant species,
and three of them visited only Penstemon digitalis (fox-
though this plant was a
glove penstemon)
minor node of the full network (Fig. 2). In our provi-
sioning habitat, there were few plants in ﬂower at the
time that the Osmia spp. were active, and because the
visitation frequency from these species was low, we do
not suggest that P. digitalis is the ideal resource for all
Osmia spp.; empirical conﬁrmation would be necessary.
However, the example demonstrates how our framework
might be used to identify such a resource for a particu-
lar objective.

yields
(e.g.,
Garibaldi et al. 2013). However, in order to have a stable,
functional wild bee community, it is necessary for there
to be sufﬁcient habitat (Winfree et al. 2007) to provide
ﬂoral resources, such as pollen and nectar (Isaacs et al.
2009). We show how network theoretical methods incor-
porate plant and pollinator phenologies to target ﬂoral
provisioning efforts to conserve and support native and
managed bee species. Although many have suggested that
networks can be used to direct conservation and manage-
ment objectives (e.g., Tylianakis et al. 2010), our study
demonstrates how network theory might have a practical
application to a real and urgent problem. Understanding
the temporal dynamics of community level interactions in

a plant–pollinator network is critical for maximizing the
provisioning of ﬂoral resources for crop pollinators and
targeting conservation efforts at species that provide polli-
nation services. In particular, knowledge of phenological
constraints on plant–pollinator interactions, and plant
species used by bee visitors, will be essential to managers
that have bee conservation as an objective.

Another advantage of our method is that it allows us
to design the ﬂoral provisioning habitat with local bee
assemblages
framework
in mind. This multispecies
emphasizes the importance of key interactions. Stable,
natural communities have particular structural aspects
that we want to design or maintain to conserve diversity
and functionality. In other words, we can select highly
generalist species that are abundant and active over long
periods of time, while sustaining rare interactions between
uncommon or specialist species. In addition, by keeping
the phenology of the whole community in mind, we can
see where it might be more vulnerable, or less stable. For
example, the nestedness of this community was lowest
early in the summer, and highest in the middle of the
season. That might pinpoint an opportunity to strengthen
the bee community by providing more ﬂower species with
an early phenology in provisioning habitat. In contrast,
the connectance of the community was highest early in

network size.

To explore the phenology of individual species, we devel-
oped a novel network measure, node duration, or the activ-
ity of interacting species over time. Node duration can
provide useful information for managers concerned about
relative ﬂowering times of ﬂoral provisioning plants and
crops. Some studies have shown a “magnet species” effect
where pollinator visitation rates to nearby species are
enhanced by the presence of a species with large ﬂoral
rewards (Molina-Montenegro et al. 2008). In this case, it
would be advantageous to synchronize the ﬂowering of
crop and nearby attractive wild plants. However, there is
also some evidence for the opposite effect, where plants
compete for pollinators (Feinsinger 1987). In this situation,
it would be ideal to have plant species that support pollina-
tors when crop species are not in ﬂower. Interaction phe-
nology allows species in the community to be selected on
the basis of the duration or seasonality of their activity
(Fig. 2), as relevant to the focal management situation;
such insights will help with the design and tractability of
ﬁeld trials or provisioning applications. Toward this end,
we explore the case study of the interaction phenology of
A. mellifera relative to the phenology of a selection of polli-
nator-dependent crop species (Fig. 6); to provide continu-
ous resources for this bee species, a manager might select
one or more provisioning species ﬂowering in each of the
three periods of the summer. In contrast, the bumblebee

We identiﬁed generalist plant species, such as V. virgin-

also E. perfoliatum that attracted a large abundance of
bees, and T. ohiensis that provided attractive resources

over a long period of time. This demonstrates that differ-
ent plant species might be used for different provisioning
objectives. In addition, three species (A. tuberosa, E. perfo-
liatum, and E. macrophylla) among the plants of our
ﬂoral provisioning habitat were consistently ranked highly
in all categories measured, and E. perfoliatum and E. mac-
rophylla still rank in the top 10 species even when we

control for the size of the ﬂoral display. These species
might be the strongest candidates for resource provision-
ing; their efﬁcacy as resources should then be the target
of ﬁeld trials. In contrast, seven species had fewer visitors
than would be expected given their ﬂoral display. This
demonstrates that the more showy ﬂowers are not neces-
sarily the most preferred by bee visitors, especially if more
attractive ﬂowers are present (but see Tuell et al. 2008).
Interestingly, measures of node betweenness and closeness
centrality were not effective for separating plant species,
likely because a subset of the plants species all had a large
number of connections and were thus equally central to
the interaction structure (Fig. 3).

Although we focused on speciﬁc plant species that
would be ideal
the
complex structure of this network demonstrates how a

for provisioning crop pollinators,

diversity of ﬂoral resources contributes to a diverse polli-
nator community. Given the asymmetric nature of our
community (and mutualistic communities in general),
generalist plant species such as V. virginicum are visited
by a large number of specialist bee species. In turn, bee
diversity has been shown to result in improved crop polli-
nation (Klein et al. 2003; Garibaldi et al. 2013). Thus,
there is a strong relationship between diversity and func-
tionality. Diverse communities provide more ecosystem
services, and communities providing ecosystem services
(i.e., pollination or ﬂoral resource provisioning) support
a higher level of diversity (Kremen et al. 2004; Isaacs
et al. 2009).

Our results also highlight pollinator species that might
augment crop pollination. There were seven consistently
generalist and abundant species that were active for most

of the summer, and central to the interaction structure.
Their periods of activity could overlap with multiple dif-
ferent crop species. Among these, B. impatiens stood out
as more than twice as abundant and was also a very gen-
eralist bee species. It is possible that choosing plants to
support B.
impatiens might encourage its population
growth. However, a different species, C. calcarata, was the
most central when ranked by both betweenness and close-
ness centrality (Fig. 5), suggesting that it has a central
role in the web of pollination services provided by these
bee species and may, in fact, contribute to the stability of
the community (Jord(cid:1)an et al. 2007).

Our approach can also be used to address speciﬁc man-
agement objectives, such as to maximize provision of
resources that help conserve a target group of pollinators.
The results of our second illustrative case study show that
three of the four Osmia spp. active in the ﬂoral provision-
ing habitat visited one plant species in particular, P. digi-
talis. As few of the plants in our study were ﬂowering

despite the low sample size, we have included this analysis
because managers are searching for new ways to support
Osmia species in orchard systems, and experimentally
testing multiple ﬂoral provisioning species (D. Biddinger,
pers. comm.). Our study suggests that an empirical test
comparing scenarios with and without P. digitalis would
help to determine whether it is a key component of ﬂoral
provisioning habitat designed to support orchard crops
that might beneﬁt from visits by Osmia spp. P. digitalis
may serve to increase the population size of Osmia spp.,

thereby enhancing crop pollination in future years. Our
method also makes explicit how the ﬂowering phenology
of plants within the provisioning habitat synchronizes
with crop phenologies. For example, P. digitalis ﬂowered
after orchard crops and would therefore not compete
with them for pollinators; instead, our work suggests that
P. digitalis plantings adjacent to orchards might support
Osmia spp. at a critical time when ﬂoral resources pro-
vided by crops are absent.

Conclusions

Pollination services are critical
for the production of
foods necessary for a healthy human diet (Eilers et al.
2011). The demand for pollinator-dependent crops is
increasing much more rapidly than the availability of pol-
lination services provided by honeybees (Aizen et al.
2008), especially in the face of Colony Collapse Disorder.
It is therefore imperative that these pollination require-
ments be supplemented with services provided by wild
require nesting and ﬂoral
bees. However, wild bees
resources (Winfree et al. 2007), and relatively little is
known about these requirements. Providing native bee
communities with
ﬂoral
resources could ensure that they not only survive but also
thrive; the beneﬁts of such habitat may also support hon-
eybees, which utilize similar ﬂoral resources, as evidenced
by the visitation of honeybees to the species in our ﬂoral
approach to assessing ﬂoral
provisioning site. Our
resources for crop pollinators integrates critical informa-
tion about the community structure and phenology of

work can be used to inform hypotheses and design exper-

conserve wild bee populations and maintain the critical
ecosystem service of pollination.
