Abstract. 1. This study investigated the effects of plant diversity, habitat type
and landscape structure on the functional diversity of the carabid assemblages
in the agro-landscape of the North China Plain. We hypothesise (i) small, her-
bivorous and omnivorous carabids are more strongly affected by local plant
diversity, while large and predatory carabids are strongly affected by landscape
structure, and (ii) habitat type inﬂuences the diversity across functional groups.
2. In 2010, carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall traps in six typical habi-
tats of the agro-landscape: wheat/maize ﬁelds, peanut ﬁelds, orchards, ﬁeld mar-
gins, windbreaks and woodland.

3. Our results showed that (i) habitat type played a predominant role in driv-
ing the changes in the diversity of carabid assemblages, followed by local plant
diversity while the landscape structure had little effect; (ii) small and omnivo-
rous carabid were strongly affected by local plant diversity, while the composi-
tion of large and predatory carabid was strongly associated with the landscape
structure; and (iii) habitats dominated by woody species harboured different
assemblages to habitats dominated by herbaceous plants for overall carabids
and three functional groups excluding omnivorous beetles.

4. Informed by our results, we suggest the differentiated responses between
functional groups should be appreciated in conservation management. In the
intensively managed agro-landscape, maintenance of diverse habitats and creat-
ing a more complex vegetation structure would be the most efﬁcient measures to
enhance the diversity of carabid assemblages. Particularly, the maintenance of
extensively managed habitats coupled with a targeted increase in the local plant
diversity is crucial to optimise the biological pest control by carabid assemblages.

species (Tscharntke et al., 2005; Norris, 2008). Accord-
ingly, the implications of agricultural management for the
protection of biodiversity and associated ecosystem ser-
vices in the agricultural landscape are increasingly recog-
nised. A variety of factors ranging from the complexity of
the landscape structure (Weibull et al., 2000; Aavik &
Liira, 2010), habitat diversity (Hendrickx et al., 2007) as

the community structure and diversity of
invertebrate
(Weibull et al., 2000; S€oderstr€om et al., 2001; Hendrickx
et al., 2007), vertebrate (S€oderstr€om et al., 2001) and
plant species assemblages (Aavik & Liira, 2010) at differ-
ent spatial scales. In particular, complex structured land-
scapes with high proportions of non-crop habitat can
enhance local diversity, where source populations can spill
over into cropland and therefore provide spatio-temporal
insurances (Tscharntke et al., 2012). Diverse habitats sup-
port higher species richness due to the widespread exis-
tence of strong species-habitat associations (Willand et al.,
2011). Habitat management intensity can also affect biodi-
versity, with less intensive managed habitat commonly
sustaining a greater diversity (Yu et al., 2006). Plant com-
munities determine the physical structure, niche and food
resource in most habitats and therefore exert considerable
inﬂuence on the distributions and interactions of animal
species considerably (Bazzaz, 1975; Lawton, 1983; McCoy
& Bell, 1991). In recognition of the importance of the
research emphasis has
agricultural
started to shift from centring on individual species and
species assemblages, protected area management and farm
practice improvements to more holistic perspectives con-
sidering conservation and sustainable management of lar-
ger regions containing a diversity of different landscape
elements (Bennett et al., 2006; Wu, 2008). Targeted modi-
ﬁcations of these factors are believed to potentially pro-
vide an effective approach to compensate for negative
effects
from intensive modern agricultural practices
(Tscharntke et al., 2005; Fischer et al., 2006).

landscape context,

in England,

In Europe, environmental and agricultural policies have
strongly promoted measures to increase landscape hetero-
geneity, habitat diversity and vegetation diversity to foster
regional biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.
Agri-environment
example,
encourage the establishment of ecological corridors, exten-
sively managed ﬁeld margins, wildﬂower strips and ‘beetle
banks’ to foster regional biodiversity and ecosystem ser-
vice provision (http://www.naturalengland.org.uk). Recent
debates, however, have put the effectiveness of such land-
scape development approaches in promoting biodiversity
into question (Kleijn & Sutherland, 2003; Roth et al.,
2008). Discrete and even diverging responses to changes
in landscape structure (Burel et al., 2004; Aviron et al.,
2005), habitat type (Gabriel et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012)
and vegetation (Woodcock et al., 2009; Tischler et al.,
2013) have emerge when comparing diversity responses of
different organism groups, especially where these also dif-
fer in their functional traits (Aviron et al., 2005; Wood-
cock et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). Body size and feeding
habit, for example, are factors potentially leading diver-
factors (Henle et al.,
gent responses to environmental
2004; Jetz et al., 2004). Larger species are expected to be
more susceptive to larger scale landscape changes than
small species (Concepci(cid:2)on & D(cid:2)ıaz, 2011), because they
have a longer duration of juvenile stages and large home
ranges (Blake et al.,1994; L€ovei & Magura, 2006; Concep-
ci(cid:2)on & D(cid:2)ıaz, 2011). Species at higher trophic levels are

suggested to be more susceptive to changes in environ-
mental conditions than species at lower levels, because
these species commonly have lower population densities,
longer juvenile stages or larger home ranges (Gard, 1984;
Holt, 1996; L€ovei & Magura, 2006). They are also
believed to be more severely affected by the larger scale
landscape structure than herbivorous and omnivorous
species (Ritchie & Olff, 1999; Purtauf et al., 2005a). These
trends reﬂect highly complex and spatially speciﬁc taxon
response patterns to environmental change, requiring the
development of a functional-group speciﬁc management
and to identify the appropriate scale for more effective
(Yaacobi et al., 2006; Gabriel
conservation measures
et al., 2010; Bat(cid:2)ary et al., 2012).

In China, with more than 50% of its terrestrial land
area under agricultural use, the intensiﬁcation of agricul-
tural production in recent decades has had strong negative
effects on agricultural biodiversity (Xu & Wilkes, 2004).
In the key cereal production area, the North China Plain
(NCP), a signiﬁcant intensiﬁcation in agricultural produc-
tion (Ju et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2010) has been associated
with a high risk of biodiversity loss. Unfortunately, biodi-
versity conservation in the agricultural landscape has so
far received limited attention (but see Liu et al., 2006,
2010, 2012), with very limited information available on
the connections between landscape structure and biodiver-
sity (EBIBAG, 2009) or on differential responses of func-
tional groups to environmental change at different scales.
An understanding of the spatial scale-dependent effects of
land-use patterns on the diversity in China’s agricultural
landscape is nonetheless vital to promote a more sustain-
able landscape management and the conservation of high
levels of biodiversity (EBIBAG, 2009).

Our study aims to address current knowledge deﬁcits,
investigating how variations in local plant diversity, habi-
tat type and landscape structure affect the diversity of the
carabid assemblages in the agricultural landscape of the
NCP. We also explore how functional grouping inﬂuences
species–environment relationships. Carabid beetles were
chosen as focal taxon as they play multiple important eco-
logical roles in agro-ecosystems especially in controlling
biological pests (Kromp, 1999) and weed species (Bohan
et al., 2011; Jonason et al., 2013). We classiﬁed carabids
into two binomial functional groups according to body
size (large vs. small) and main feeding traits during their
life cycle (predatory vs. omnivorous). Previous studies
indicated strong effects of landscape structure (de la Pe~na
et al., 2003; Purtauf et al., 2005b) or both local and land-
scape-scale factors on carabid assemblages (Aviron et al.,
2005; Werling and Gratton 2008). Beetle responses have
been suggested to vary with functional traits such as body
size, feeding habit or habitat afﬁnity (Aviron et al., 2005;
Bat(cid:2)ary et al., 2007; Clough et al., 2007). Predatory cara-
bid species have been reported to be more affected by
changing landscape
than herbivorous and
omnivorous species (Purtauf et al., 2005a). We hypothes-
ise that carabid beetles response to environmental factors
depend on their functional traits. Predatory and large

species, which have good dispersal abilities,
large home
range sizes, long life cycles and are hence more susceptible
to human disturbances, are believed to be more strongly
affected by the overall
landscape structure and more
abundant in less intensively managed habitats. In con-
trast, omnivorous and small beetles are hypothetically
more strongly linked to local plant diversity because of
their lower dispersal ability, smaller home ranges and
lower sensitivity to disturbance. Finally, the habitat type
is hypothesised to inﬂuence the diversity across the func-
tional groups.

Materials and methods

Study area and site selection

This

study was

conducted at Xitiange village

in
Northeastern Miyun County (40(cid:3)210–40(cid:3)250N, 116(cid:3)420–
116(cid:3)470E) near the northern boundary of the NCP. The
area is situated about 70 km north of Beijing city centre.
The local climate is continental, with an annual tempera-
ture of 11.5 °C and an average annual precipitation of
~700 mm.

the sampled land-

The six most common habitats in the research region:
wheat/maize rotation ﬁelds, peanut ﬁelds, woodland,
windbreaks, ﬁeld margins and orchards, were selected for
beetle sampling. Field margins were deﬁned as linear non-
cropping areas with a naturally colonised grass-dominated
vegetation covering a width >2 m between ﬁelds. Wind-
breaks consisted of poplar tree lines planted between
ﬁelds. Woodland was also planted with Populus spp., but
had a much greater width with an overall area exceeding
1 ha.

In maize/wheat ﬁelds, about 300 kg ha(cid:2)1 of N fertilizer
and 110 kg ha(cid:2)1 of P2O5 were applied during two grow-
ing season. Herbicides were applied after each crop sow-
ing and pesticides were applied once in spring and
autumn respectively. In peanut ﬁelds, about 60 kg ha(cid:2)1 of
N fertilizer and 170 kg ha(cid:2)1 of P2O5 were applied in addi-
tion to herbicides and fungicides, which were sprayed
after sowing and ﬂowering respectively. No fertilizer was
applied in the orchards, while fungicide was sprayed after
the ﬂowering. No agro-chemicals were used in woodland,
windbreaks and on the ﬁeld margins.

The sampling sites were located in the plain area that
covers about 27% of Xitiange village mainly to the
south of
the village centre. In this area, agricultural
land accounts for about 55% of the total area, while
residential and roads account
for a further 21%
(Fig. 1). The most common agricultural crops are winter
wheat/summer maize and peanuts, with large areas also
used as fruit orchards. Semi-natural land, which mainly
consists of woodland, windbreaks, ﬁeld margins, weeds

Beetle and plant surveys

Beetles were sampled over periods of 6 days every
month between the beginning of May and the end of Sep-
tember 2010 using a total of ﬁve pitfall traps at each plot.
Arrangements of pitfall traps were adjusted according to
the shape of habitat to enable more typical catchment of
fauna (Kotze et al., 2011) and also to limit the edge effect

in linear habitats. At the agricultural ﬁelds, orchards and
in woodland, plots measuring 20 9 20 m2 were estab-
lished, and ﬁve pitfall traps were placed at the centre of
each of these plots and at a distance of 5 m from the plot
centre along N–S and E–W facing diagonal lines. At ﬁeld
margins and windbreaks, plots were established at the
centre of these linear habitats to minimise edge effects. To
achieve comparative results across the different habitats,
ﬁve traps in these linear habitats were placed with a dis-
tance of 5 m between individual pitfall traps as in agricul-
tural lands.

The % cover of vascular plant species was surveyed in
June and September 2010. Within each plot, all tree and
shrub species were recorded in four randomly selected
1 m 9 5 m sub-plots, while herb species were surveyed in
four randomly selected 1 m 9 1 m sub-plots. Data sets in
both seasons for each plot were combined, allocating the
maximum % cover recorded at these two sampling events
to each plant species.

Landscape data

Land-use types in the study region were digitised based
on an extensive ﬁeld mapping surveys in combination
with high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery (resolu-
tion 0.6 m) during sampling season. Landscape metrics
within a radius of 300 m were considered in this study as
it was supposed that most carabid beetles disperse within
the limited distance of up to 50 m (Welsh, 1990) and
respond to landscape structure at ﬁne spatial scales (Avi-
ron et al., 2005; Bat(cid:2)ary et al., 2007). Shannon Diversity
Index was selected as an indicator for the heterogeneity of
landscape structure as it is widely applied in research on
(Concepci(cid:2)on et al.,
landscape–biodiversity relationships
2008; Bassa et al., 2011), and it was calculated using
FRAGSTATS 3.3 (Mcgarigal et al., 2002).

Data analysis

Carabid beetles were divided into small (<15 mm) and
large species (>15 mm) (Cole et al., 2002) according to
their averaged body size measured using a vernier calliper.
They were also divided into predators and omnivores
according to their predominantly feeding traits during
their entire life cycle (Antonenko, 1980; Yu, 1980, 1981;
Deng, 1983; Deng et al., 1985; Liang & Yu, 2000; Sasaka-
wa, 2007, 2009). As little information is available for the
feeding habits of Chinese carabids, we categorised them
depending on assumptions on the basis of taxonomic
afﬁnity in the cases where information for a speciﬁc spe-
cies was lacking. Accordingly, Amara spp. was assumed
to be omnivorous (H(cid:3)urka & Jaro(cid:2)s(cid:2)ık, 2003). Harpalus
spp., which tends to be gramnivorous, but is also known
to utilise other food sources (Brandmayr, 1990; Deng
1983; Kirk, 1973; Liang & Yu, 2000; Lund & Turpin,
1977; Yu, 1981), was categorised as omnivorous.

Beetle data for each plot were pooled for subsequent
analysis. Non-metric multidimensional scaling base on
Chord distances was applied to analyse species turnover
rates of different carabid groups between sites using
PAST (Hammer et al., 2001). Species richness was calcu-
lated using EstimateS V9.1.0 (Colwell, 2013) based on the
Chao1 species richness estimator to account for the inevi-
table confounding effects of sample size resulting from the
varied shapes of investigated habitats and arrangement of
pitfall traps. The Gini-Simpson diversity index which em-
phasises ‘evenness’ of the community and varies between
0 and 1 was calculated to characterise the diversity of the
plant communities using the statistical package PAST
(Hammer et al., 2001).

To investigate the effects of landscape structure, habitat
type and local plant diversity on the activity-abundance
and estimated species richness of each beetle group, linear
mixed effect models with ﬁxed variance (gls, nlme package
version 3.1-108 in R) (Pinheiro et al., 2013) were used in
R 2.15.2 (R Core Team, 2012). Landscape diversity, habi-
tat type as well as local plant diversity were used as ﬁxed
predictors, and the model was simpliﬁed using the step-
AIC function in the package MASS (Venables & Ripley,
2002). The normality of the distribution of the raw-depen-
dent variables was assessed using QQ–plots. Data were
log10-transformed or sqrt-transformed where necessary.
To account for spatial autocorrelation, we ﬁtted gls mod-
els to response variables with Gauss–Kr€uger coordinates
treated as spatial covariates, assuming a spherical spatial
correlation structure (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000), but no spa-
tial autocorrelation was found.

Three separate partial redundancy analyses (pRDA)
were used to investigate the separate effects of local plant
diversity, habitat type and landscape diversity on species
composition of the all beetle assemblages and the four
functional groups when combining the other two variables
as conditional variables. Prior to the analyses, the beetle
species matrix was modiﬁed using Hellinger transforma-
tion (Legendre & Gallagher, 2001) in preparation for the
use in PCA and RDA Pseudo-F values and the corre-
sponding signiﬁcance levels were calculated based on 999
Monte-Carlo permutations. Finally, spatial autocorrela-
tions of plots were diagnosed using the mso function, but
no spatial patterns were apparent. Calculations were
performed using the vegan package (version 2.0-2)
in
R (Oksanen et al., 2012).

individuals were predatory, while the remaining 12 species
accounting for 969 individuals were classed as omnivores.
Among the omnivorous carabids, more than 97% of the
individuals were also small species. Accordingly, more
than 75% of small carabids were omnivorous. On the
other hand, 94% of large individuals were classed as pred-
atory, but only 61% of the predatory individuals repre-
sented large species. Harpalus pastor, Dolichus halensis,
Chlaenius posticalis and Harpalus pallidipennis were the
four most common species in the sampled agricultural
landscape, accounting for 43.3%, 21.3%, 17.5% and
8.2% of all sampled individuals respectively.

The NMDS ordination showed that plots dominated by
woody plants including orchards, windbreaks and wood-
land harboured distinctly different carabid species assem-
blage from the plots dominated by herbaceous plants,
including wheat/maize ﬁelds, peanut ﬁelds and ﬁeld mar-
gins (Fig. 2a). This distinction was also evident for large
carabids (Fig. 2b), small carabids (Fig. 2c) and predators
(Fig. 2d). In contrast, all sampling plots for omnivorous
carabids were closely clustered together with an exception
of four plots, indicating a more homogenous composition
of omnivorous carabid species across the sampled habitats
(Fig. 2e).

Effects of local plant diversity, habitat type and landscape
structure on abundance and diversity

Activity-abundance and species richness.

The activity-
abundance of the overall carabid assemblage and of the
four functional groups were strongly inﬂuenced by the dif-
ference in habitat types, but not by landscape diversity
and local plant diversity (Table 1). Peanut ﬁelds generally
harboured the lowest activity-abundance, followed gener-
ally by woodland activity-abundance levels
(Fig. 3a).
Field margins in contrast were characterised by a high
activity-abundance of large and predatory carabids, and
in orchards a high activity-abundance of carabid species
across all four groups.

Differences in species richness for the overall carabid
assemblages, large and predatory carabid functional groups
were all strongly associated with differences in habitat type,

but no differences were observed for the species richness of
both small and omnivorous carabids (Table 1). Peanut
ﬁelds harboured the lowest species richness for the overall
carabid assemblage and all functional groups (Fig. 3b).
Wheat/maize ﬁeld, ﬁeld margins and orchard harboured a
large species richness of both large and predatory carabids,
while woodland assemblages contained a large number of
predatory carabids (Fig. 3b). In addition, species richness
of small carabid was positively associated with plant diver-
sity (Table 1; Fig. 4), while omnivorous species richness
responded to none of the parameters landscape structure,
habitat type or local plant diversity (Table 1).

Species composition.

The partial RDA ordination
plots indicate varied responses of beetle assemblages to
the individual variable of landscape diversity, habitat type
and plant diversity across the different functional carabid
groups when the effects of the other two of these three
variables were excluded (Table 2). The overall carabid
assemblage was signiﬁcantly associated with habitat type
and local plant diversity, but not with landscape diversity.
Large carabid assemblages changed signiﬁcantly only
between habitat types, while shifts in small and omnivo-
rous carabid assemblages were again associated with both
changes in habitat type and local plant diversity. Preda-
tory carabid turnover ﬁnally was not signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with any of

iation (>21%) in the species composition across all cara-
bid groups; species composition of overall, small and

to plant diversity than by landscape structures. In con-
trasted, large and predatory carabid assemblages, whose
species compositions were much more explained by land-
scape structure than by local plant diversity.

diversity of invertebrate taxa (Kareiva, 1983; Siemann,
1998). On one hand, increasing in plant species richness
can potentially support increasing numbers of specialised
consumers (Murdoch et al., 1972; Siemann et al., 1998),
which in turn can encourage a greater diversity of preda-
tors through cascade effects (Hunter & Price, 1992). On
the other hand, plant communities can impact consumer
diversity indirectly by mediating the physical structure of

the environment, which again increases in heterogeneity
with increasing plant species richness, with implications
for distribution and interactions of species in the increased
niche spaces (Lawton, 1983; McCoy & Bell, 1991). The
strong association observed between changes in overall
beetle and plant species composition in our study could
be explained by either of these direct and indirect effects,
especially in relation to the strong correlation between

The

related

bottom-up

signiﬁcant association between the

functional
groups of both omnivores and small carabids, but not
predatory or large beetles, with plant diversity is congru-
ent with observations made in previous studies (Harvey
et al., 2008; (cid:4)Seri(cid:2)c Jelaska et al., 2010). The previous stud-
ies suggested that herbivore diversity is affected predomi-

availability, a trend commonly reported in environments
with poor plant species diversity, while top-down effects
are believed to become more pronounced in environments
with high-quality plants or in high-productivity (Hunter &
Price, 1992; Stiling & Rossi, 1997; Denno et al., 2002). As
seed feeding species contribute strongly to the groups of
omnivores and small carabid beetles in this study, their
strong association with plant diversity could indeed be
explained by bottom-up effects of resource availability.
Top-down effects related to predation pressure might also
be at work. For example, in the case of peanut ﬁelds, very
low plant coverage could lead to small beetles being more
prone to attack from their natural enemies.

It is remarkable that predatory and large beetles did
not show any signiﬁcant links with plant diversity in this
study. Predators are often assumed to be more abundant
and more diverse in species-rich plant communities with a
greater variety of habitats and more availability of prey
according to the natural enemy hypothesis (Jactel et al.,
2005). Scherber et al. (2010) however, showed that the
links between plant diversity and arthropod diversity
dampen with increasing trophic level. The lack of correla-
tion between plant diversity and predatory and large bee-
tles could be explained by the poor habitat quality of
some of the investigated habitats so that they were unable
to support sufﬁcient numbers of herbivores to sustain
large predator assemblages, or by predatory and large
beetles having strong dispersal ability, enabling them to
use resources at large spatial scales. Vegetation structure
still appears to play a role in affecting the composition of
predatory and large beetles, as indicated by the differen-
tial species composition between habitats dominated by
woody and herbaceous plant species for both predatory
and large beetles.

Effects of habitat

In accordance with our initial hypothesis, habitat type
presented a key factor in determining the overall diversity
of carabids. As also mentioned above, the distinct plant
structure of the different habitats determines the availabil-
ity of both structural niches and environmental resources
required by the different carabid species (Bazzaz, 1975;
Mortimer et al., 1998; Brose, 2003; Asteraki et al., 2004;
Axmacher et al., 2009). This is further supported by the
observed distinct species assemblages supported by the
structurally more complex woody habitats, which also
tended to support a greater taxonomic diversity of plant
species. Habitat types are also closely linked to distur-
bance intensity and productivity (Murison et al., 2007;

Liu et al., 2012). Agricultural intensiﬁcation is commonly
seen as a main cause of biodiversity loss (Matson et al.,
1997; Wilson et al., 1999), despite observations that inten-
sively managed habitats can sometimes support diverse
and abundant populations of ground beetles when they
provide large quantities of potential resources in some
cases (Tscharntke et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2010). Carabids
are nonetheless generally known to show higher diversity
levels in habitats with less intensive management (Carca-
mo et al., 1995; Pﬁffner & Luka, 2003). Therefore, the
low activity-abundance and species richness of the overall
carabid assemblages in peanut ﬁelds could be further con-
tributed to higher management intensity and much sim-
pler and more homogenous vegetation structure in these
habitats. The heterogeneous carabid species composition
of large and predatory species as well as in the overall
species assemblage for habitats dominated by herbaceous
plants could similarly be related to the stronger gradient
in management intensity. Furthermore, the cultivation of
annual crops on these sites will strongly inﬂuence their
microclimatic conditions, which form a further, important
factor determining carabid distribution (Thiele, 1977). It
is therefore likely that the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the habi-
tat type on the diversity of all carabid groups can be
attributed to the interaction of several factors including
plant diversity and plant structure, productivity, land-use
intensity and microclimate conditions. This complex inter-
action appears to lead to a strong similarity in activity-
abundance and species richness between the intensively
managed, more productive wheat/maize ﬁelds and exten-
sively managed, more structurally complex habitats, such
as orchards, ﬁeld margins and woodland.

Effects of landscape structure

Wider landscape structure has been demonstrated to
signiﬁcantly affect carabid species richness and density
(Burel et al., 1998; Purtauf et al., 2005a,b; Bat(cid:2)ary et al.,
2007; Diek€otter et al., 2010), as well as on ground beetle
species composition (de la Pe~na et al., 2003; Aviron et al.,
2005; Diek€otter et al., 2010). Carabids with different traits
also show different responses to landscape structure, with
species richness of carnivorous and phytophagous carabid
species decreasing with a decrease in non-cropping area in
the landscape, while no effects on species richness were
observed for omnivorous species (Purtauf et al., 2005a).
The relative abundance of large species (>15 mm) was
also found to signiﬁcantly correlate with the proportion
of woody elements in the landscape, whereas small species
were not similarly affected (Aviron et al., 2005).
In contrast to the above published results,

landscape
structure did not show any signiﬁcant effects on abun-
dance or species richness of the overall carabid assem-
blage and the four functional groups investigated in our
study. Although consisted with our hypothesis that land-
scape structure showed a greater relative impact on the
species composition of large and predatory carabid in

studies
reporting strong positive effects of a heterogeneous land-
scape on local arthropod diversity (see also Weibull
et al., 2000; Clough et al., 2005; Bat(cid:2)ary et al., 2007), the
landscape investigated in this study was overall rather
homogenous and had experienced serious semi-natural
loss and fragmentation for
several millennia due to
strong anthropogenic inﬂuences, leaving no natural resid-
ual habitats. The substantial habitat loss and fragmenta-
tion would result dramatic loss of biodiversity before
this investigation. The most
‘natural’ habitats in the
landscape we investigated are mainly formed by monoto-
nous monocultures of poplar (woodland and windbreak)
or secondary herbaceous vegetation, largely restricted to
‘edge’ environments of a lower habitat
than
pristine habitats would have contained. Overall, any hab-
itat specialists specialised on the potential natural vegeta-
tion will have been lost, and the resulting assemblages
are predominantly composed of generalist species which
least partly adapted to crop land (Tscharntke
are at
et al., 2012). The lack of any natural habitat
in the
the study area would rule out any
wider vicinity of
cross-habitat spillover from natural habitats into the
agricultural landscape. With more than 75% of the total
landscape being under cultivation or classed as residen-
tial and roads areas and another 12% being covered in
semi-natural habitats, the local traits and quality of hab-
itats can therefore be expected to be more important
than the surrounding landscape matrix in determining
the ground beetle species composition and diversity
(Tscharntke et al., 2005).

Effects of sampling methods

Although pitfall trapping is the most commonly used
the method in to gain standardised quantitative samples
of carabid beetles in ecological studies, its effective cap-
ture rates depend both on activity patterns and popula-
the captured species (Mitchell, 1963;
tion densities of
Greenslade, 1964). Habitat-related or traits-related differ-
ences in the activity patterns of carabid species therefore
somewhat complicate direct comparisons of pitfall trap-
ping results (Spence & Niemel€a, 1994), and the subsequent
analysis of assemblage data (Kotze et al., 2011). Unfortu-
nately, these drawbacks in pitfall-trapped samples remain
unresolved (Kotze et al., 2011). The different arrangement
of pitfall traps between different habitat types in our
results as well,

nise that there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of

results obtained solely from pitfall trapping. Combina-

Implications for conservation

With a long history of agricultural use, little natural or
even semi-natural residual habitats remaining in this key
area of China’s cereal production. A ﬁrst important mea-
sure to support and enhance the existing regional bio-
diversity in the
focus on
improvements at small spatial scales. As our study indi-
cates, the habitat type and plant diversity currently play
an important role in driving the diversity of the overall
carabid assemblages. A diverse range of cropping systems
in the landscape is therefore seen as critical for enhancing
the carabid diversity. Speciﬁcally, extensively managed
orchards appear to be of high value for carabid conserva-
tion particularly when there is a high production pressure
on the land due to food requirements and to ensure the
farmers’ income. Field margins which are allowed to go
through succession to increase in complexity and in their
proportion of woody plant components could also be an
economic and efﬁcient way to promote the abundance
particularly of large and predatory carabids, which are
(Yu et al.,
the key group in arthropod pests control
2006). In addition, given the strong effects of the plant
future
community on overall ground beetle diversity,
management of non-cropping habitats should be aimed
towards creating a more complex vegetation structure
with higher levels of plant diversity. Speciﬁcally, habitats
containing woody vegetation such as orchard, woodland
and windbreak in addition to semi-natural ﬁeld margins,
should be maintained and sustainably managed as a fur-
ther loss of such habitat would be detrimental to the bio-
logical control service in the agricultural
landscape. At
the same time, the plant species composition should be
carefully managed (Landis et al., 2000; Fiedler et al.,
2008), as particularly small and omnivorous ground beetle
species, which show strong association with plant diversity
in our study, are known to form agricultural pests them-
selves
(Yu, 1980). Given our
substantial knowledge gaps in this area, a better under-
standing of plant–insect relationships is critical to formu-
late clear guidance for the enhancement of biodiversity
and associated ecosystem services in the agricultural land-
scape.

in some circumstances

Despite a less pronounced effect of the landscape struc-
ture on carabid assemblages in comparison to habitat and
plant diversity and the scarcity of any pristine habitats in
the study area, maintaining landscape heterogeneity is
particularly important to support the biological pests con-
trol function of ground beetles. This is crucially important
for predatory carabid since variation in predatory carabid
assemblage was much more strongly linked to landscape
structure than local plant diversity. On the other hand,

the 17 species sampled in six different habitats during a
period of 30 sampling days between May and September
indicated an overall very low level of species richness in
the local carabid species pool compared to other regions
(Liu et al., 2012) or even to other villages in the same
area (Yu et al., 2006 – unfortunately these study sites
have now been replaced by a residential area due to the
rapid urbanisation of Beijing). On a longer term, measures
at larger scales, like ecological networks connecting agri-
cultural
land with high-quality natural or semi-natural
habitats, could be effective steps for the recovery of the
remaining biodiversity in the entire region (Jones-Walters,
2007).

Conclusion

The key ﬁnding of this study is that it is habitat and local
plant diversity rather than landscape structure are driving
the changes in diversity of carabid assemblages; and cara-
bid beetles, response patterns to local plant diversity and
landscape structure depending on their functional traits.
Small and omnivorous carabid assemblages are more
affected local plant diversity, while large and predatory
carabid assemblages are more strongly associated with
landscape structure. Conservation management needs to
consider these spatially varied responses of
functional
groups to optimise diversity and biological pest control
service. In the intensively managed agricultural landscape
of the NCP, a tailored increase in habitat diversity and
local plant diversity can therefore provide a good starting
point to support the carabid diversity and assemblage
structure. In the long term, the establishment of a pro-
tected area network speciﬁcally based on strongly
degraded agricultural habitats left to natural vegetation
succession and linking the overall agricultural landscape
with remnants of pristine habitats could enable the future
enhancement of the carabid biodiversity and their biologi-
cal pest control service.
